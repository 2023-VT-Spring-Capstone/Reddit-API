I think the only way he's going to surprise the market is if he suggests rates need to go higher than the market is pricing, but that's highly unlikely because the data since the last meeting wouldn't support it.

He could also go 50bps which is more likely. But I'm not sure if 50bps is bearish or bullish for stocks unless it's coupled with raising expectations of the terminal rate. Going 50bps without that will just suggest that the pause (and maybe cuts) will come sooner.

So really you have two options, a toothless hawkish 25/50bps hike, or a dovish hike. Neither or which seem particularly worrying.

I think the only way he's going to surprise the market is if he suggests rates need to go higher than the market is pricing, but that's highly unlikely because the data since the last meeting wouldn't support it.

He could also go 50bps which is more likely. But I'm not sure if 50bps is bearish or bullish for stocks unless it's coupled with raising expectations of the terminal rate. Going 50bps without that will just suggest that the pause (and maybe cuts) will come sooner.

I think the only way he's going to surprise the market is if he suggests rates need to go higher than the market is pricing, but that's highly unlikely because the data since the last meeting wouldn't support it.

He could also go 50bps which is more likely. But I'm not sure if 50bps is bearish or bullish for stocks unless it's coupled with raising expectations of the terminal rate. Going 50bps without that will just suggest that the pause (and maybe cuts) will come sooner.

I think the only way he's going to surprise the market is if he suggests rates need to go higher than the market is pricing, but that's highly unlikely because the data since the last meeting wouldn't support it.

He could also go 50bps which is more likely. But I'm not sure if 50bps is bearish or bullish for stocks unless it's coupled with raising expectations of the terminal rate. Going 50bps without that will just suggest that the pause (and maybe cuts) will come sooner.
